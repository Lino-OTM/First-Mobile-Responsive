# First-Mobile-Responsive

My first mobile responsive design only using HTML and CSS. 

I created this on my first course, and I tried to make the most of my knowledge using HTML and CSS, there's not much to talk about, this is only the beginning!
Pd: Everything is written in spanish because it's for an international company which needed an spanish version of their product.
