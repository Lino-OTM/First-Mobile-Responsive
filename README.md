# First-Mobile-Responsive

This is my first mobile responsive design only using HTML and CSS. 

I created this on my first course, and I tried to make the most of my knowledge using HTML and CSS.

You can check the project based on a Figma layout here: https://www.figma.com/proto/sMmlQaZldfDcLERYYWe6h4/Bata-Bit?node-id=44%3A594&scaling=scale-down
